// Garrett.is - A Portfolio I built for myself in Spring 2015
//
// The idea behind this project was to use the base url garrett.is/ as the semantic structure
// and to use wordpress to dynamically generate syntactically correct url's on top of that
// basic url.
//
// This is accomplished using the variables $verb for category names, and the variable $noun for 
// post names. By keeping the variable in the back end consistent, I was able to define a naming
// convention that allowed me to keep url syntax consistent in the front end.
